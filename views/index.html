                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Computer Programming and Analysis student who has experience using languages such as C#, JavaScript, HTML, Java, Python, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently in my final term at [College Name Here], enrolled in Computer Programming and Analysis for an advanced diploma. Throughout my studies, 
                        I've developed strong problem solving skills, and learned to collaborate effectively with teams. My course work and projects have given me hands-on 
                        experience building and testing software applications and websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my personal life, I enjoy taking on side coding projects and experimenting with new setups on my home server. Outside of technology, 
                        I also enjoy reading and gaming.

                    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Code should be clear, organized, and easy to understand. This belief motivates me to write clean, well-commented code and follow best 
                        practices so that anyone can easily build upon my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in taking full responsibility for my work, including both its successes and its mistakes. Owning my decisions 
                        helps me grow, learn, and continuously improve the quality of my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staying curious is essential to success. The programming field evolves so quickly, I make it a priority to keep learning 
                        and stay current with new tools, technologies, and industry trends.
